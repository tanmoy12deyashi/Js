    <!-- The <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.-->
    <!-- The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.-->

    <!-- Isolate the usernames from the surrounding text-direction settings:-->
    <p>This is normal text - <b>and this is bold text</b>.</p>
    <!-- Use CSS to set bold text:-->
    <p>This is normal text - <span style="font-weight:bold;">and this is bold text</span>.</p>

    <!-- The <b> tag specifies bold text without any extra importance.-->
    <!-- Note: According to the HTML5 specification, the <b> tag should be used as a LAST resort when no other tag is more appropriate. The specification states that headings should be denoted with the <h1> to <h6> tags, emphasized text should be denoted with the <em> tag, important text should be denoted with the <strong> tag, and marked/highlighted text should be denoted with the <mark> tag.-->
    <!-- Tip: You can also use the following CSS to set bold text: "font-weight: bold;".-->

    </ul>
    <!-- BDI stands for Bi-Directional Isolation.-->
    <!-- The <bdi> tag isolates a part of text that might be formatted in a different direction from other text outside it.-->
    <!-- This element is useful when embedding user-generated content with an unknown text direction-->


    <!-- Specify the text direction-->
    <bdo dir="rtl">This text will go right-to-left.</bdo>
    <!-- BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.-->
    <!-- The <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction.-->

The world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by 1.2 million members in the United States and close to 5 million globally.</blockquote>
    <!-- The <blockquote> tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source.-->
    <!-- Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements (look at example below to see how to remove the indentation).-->
    <!-- Tip: Use <q> for inline (short) quotations.-->
